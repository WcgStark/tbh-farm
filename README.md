# TBH Co-pilot

An optimization companion for the idle-RPG [TBH: Task Bar Hero](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3678970/TBH_Task_Bar_Hero/).
It reads your save **locally in the browser**, decrypts it, and tells you the optimal next move: where to
farm, when to come back, when you'll level, which runes and gear to get, and how much power each change buys.

100% local &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; free, no ads, no tracking &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; no install, no server &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; 16 languages

## Why

Combat is automatic, so the game is less about reflexes and more about decisions: which heroes to field,
where to spend gold, which floor gives the best loot per minute. TBH Co-pilot answers all of that from your
actual save, live, with no spreadsheets and no manual input. Everything is computed in your browser and
nothing ever leaves your machine.

## Features

| Area | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Party roster** | Game sprites, POWER, DPS share, EHP, level and XP/ETA, unspent ability points, equipped gear. Click a hero for a full stat sheet that breaks every stat down by source. |
| **Farm optimizer** | The wiki Farming Optimizer idea, automated. It calibrates your real clear rate from your measured gold/sec and ranks every cleared stage by gold/hour and exp/hour, with a sortable table (clear time, EXP/HP and Gold/HP density). It sends you to the dense, fast stage instead of an unclearable floor. |
| **Idle / return timer** | Offline reward curve, the optimal time to come back (the 8 h cap), and what to park on first. |
| **Interactive rune tree** | All 197 nodes laid out and colored by category. Pick a category (EXP, Combat, Gold, Items, Chest, Inventory, Offline, Utility) and the tree highlights that branch and lists the three cheapest buyable nodes. Almost-free runes are called out. |
| **Build planners** | Power delta per rune, the cheapest path to your first DPS rune, an ordered gold-spend cart, attribute-point and enchant advice, pet and synthesis tips, all in the Lab. |
| **Gear advisor** | Per slot "is it worth swapping?" with the POWER delta of any change, plus empty-jewelry and enchant nudges. |
| **Background watcher** | A PowerShell notifier (`monitor.ps1`) that fires Windows toasts for the moments that matter: level-ups, a dropped item that is actually an upgrade, an almost-free rune you can afford, gold milestones, and more. |
| **16 languages** | UI and game content localized; the stat model is calibrated against the in-game Status panel. |

## Quick start

**Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)**

1. Open it in Chrome or Edge (it uses the File System Access API and Web Crypto).
2. Click Connect save and pick your save once:
   `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\TesseractStudio\TaskbarHero\SaveFile_Live.es3`
3. Done. It tracks the save live and updates as you play. Or click "demo" to look around first.

**Lab (`tools/lab.html`)** is the what-if simulator (POWER delta per item), history charts, and the
build, economy and drops panels.

**Watcher (`monitor.ps1`)** gives background desktop notifications while the game idles in your taskbar:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File monitor.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File monitor.ps1 -NoToast
```

It needs [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) on PATH, because it reuses the same engine as the dashboard.

## How it works

The save (encrypted ES3 / AES-CBC) is decrypted with Web Crypto, and the game data the app needs is bundled
into `engine/gamedata.js`. There are no network calls at runtime, no backend, and no build step.

One engine drives all three surfaces: `engine/engine.js` (UMD, runs in the browser and in Node) computes
effective DPS/EHP/POWER, leveling, the calibrated farm optimizer, idle, the rune tree and planners, and the
gear and enchant deltas. The dashboard, the Lab and the watcher all call the same `recommend()`. The stat
model was checked against the in-game Status panel so the numbers match what the game shows.

```
dashboard.html        the live dashboard (open this)
tools/lab.html        the Lab: what-if, history, build, economy, drops
monitor.ps1           background Windows-toast watcher
monitor/advisor.cjs   Node bridge so the watcher reuses the engine
engine/               engine.js, gamedata.js, i18n.js, demo.js, build scripts
assets/               game icons and sprites the UI shows
data/                 trimmed stage and rune tables
```

## Privacy and ethics

Your save never leaves your computer. It is read and decrypted locally, with no servers, analytics, or
trackers. The project is free, has no ads, and there is no intention to ever make money from it. Use it,
fork it, self-host it.
